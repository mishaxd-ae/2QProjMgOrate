            Komodo started on 2007 with its first release on January 2010, and its latest release, the Komodo Dragon 2.5 on September 24 this year.
            The engine is written on C and C++. The engine is commercial, but its older versions are free.
            The engine has a playstyle that focuses on evaluation instead of analysis depth.
